# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. I am an aspiring Security Analyst currently completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. My work focuses on threat detection, security audits, Linux security, SIEM analysis, and risk assessment.

This portfolio showcases my hands-on projects, labs, documentation, and homelab work as I transition into a career in cybersecurity.

## 👤 About Me

I come from a hands-on background in construction and field operations, where attention to detail, safety, and risk management are critical every day. Those experiences translate directly into cybersecurity: identifying risks, following procedures, documenting incidents, and keeping people and systems safe.

I’m currently building skills in:

- Security operations and monitoring  
- Incident response and documentation  
- System hardening and access control  
- Vulnerability identification and remediation  

My goal is to grow into a Security Analyst / SOC Analyst role where I can apply both my technical skills and real-world operations experience.
