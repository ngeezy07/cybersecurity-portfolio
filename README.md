# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. I am an aspiring Security Analyst completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and developing hands-on skills in threat detection, system hardening, SIEM analysis, Linux security, and risk assessment.

This portfolio documents my labs, tools, projects, homelab work, and practical security exercises as I transition into a full-time cybersecurity role.

## 👤 About Me

I come from a hands-on background in **construction and field operations**, where safety, risk awareness, communication, and real-world problem-solving were essential. Those same strengths translate directly into cybersecurity:

- Identifying risks early  
- Following procedures and policies  
- Documenting incidents clearly  
- Operating under pressure  
- Protecting people, equipment, and systems  

Now I'm applying those skills to:

- Security Operations  
- Threat Detection & Response  
- System Hardening  
- Network & Linux Security  
- SIEM Analysis  

My goal is to grow into a **Security Analyst / SOC Analyst** role where I can combine technical skills with operational discipline and risk awareness.
